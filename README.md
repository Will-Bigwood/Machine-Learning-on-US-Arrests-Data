# Unsupervised Machine-Learning on US Arrests Data
### Introduction
This report explores the differences between the 50 US States in the ‘US Arrests’ dataset using unsupervised learning methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, and Hierarchical clustering. The aim is to determin the level of violent crime in each of the 50 states.
The data set (UsArrests.csv) contains statistics in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.
### Getting Started
To run the code you will need to install Python in your device. The code uses the following Python libraries which will also need to be installed in order to run the code without encountering any errors:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Scipy
- Geopandas
  
Ensure that the Us_Arrests.csv is in the same directory as the Python file in order for it to run without error.

Ensure that all the following files are also in the same directory as the Python file in order to correctly generate geographical visualisations with Geopandas: 'tl_2021_us_state.cpg', 'tl_2021_us_state.dbf', 'tl_2021_us_state.prj', 'tl_2021_us_state.shp', 'tl_2021_us_state.shp.ea.iso.xml', 'tl_2021_us_state.shp.iso.xml', and 'tl_2021_us_state.shx'.
